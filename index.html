            <div>
            <p>I'm a relatively new visual designer and website developer looking for opportunities to work on new projects. I'd say that that my strengths 
                are in my communicative style, years of experience in management, and my strong desire to learn new things and apply my knowledge in new roles.
                Even this web page is just a fun way to challenge myself to design a resume using only html and to test my memory on the things I've learned 
                over the last few years.</p>
